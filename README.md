In this project, the goal is to grasp essential JavaScript basics such as variables, conditionals, and native methods, within a distraction-free coding environment, shedding the usual webpage complexities.

## The problem

Approached through a straight dive into JavaScript logic, the focus was on honing variable usage (envisioned as data containers), employing conditionals for smart decision-making, and exploiting native methods for streamlined operations. Planning involved a step-by-step breakdown of these core concepts, utilizing JavaScript as the sole technology. Given more time, extending this base to more advanced JavaScript features and perhaps integrating with HTML/CSS for web page interactions would be the next steps.
